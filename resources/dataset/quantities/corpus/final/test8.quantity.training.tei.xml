        <p>Organic carbon production, mineralisation and preservation on the Peruvian margin 3–4 times higher than the global shelf average of <measure type="value"><num>500</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> (Burwicz et al., 2011). They corresponded to sedimentation rates (ωacc) of <measure type="list"><num>0.45</num> and <num>0.3</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> (Table 2). Beyond the middle shelf, MAR decreased sharply to <measure type="list"><num>132</num> and <num>44</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 2 (11◦ S) and St. 8 (12◦ S), respectively. These latter values are associated with measurable 210Pbxs in the upper 3 cm only and thus indicative of sediment winnowing or resuspension, as mentioned above. A relatively low MAR of <measure type="value"><num>128</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> was also determined for St. 4 at 12◦ S compared to the neighbouring stations. MAR and ωacc tended to be higher at the deep oxygenated stations compared to the OMZ stations, withωacc of <measure type="value"><num>0.06</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 10 (12◦ S) and <measure type="value"><num>0.05</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 5 (11◦ S).

POC accumulation rates for the middle shelf and deep stations were calculated from the mass accumulation rates and POC content at 10 cm (Table 2). Due to recent variations in POC content for the OMZ stations, the average POC content in the upper 10 cm was used. For St. 8 at 12◦ S (409 m), POC accumulation was calculated at 3 cm, since the underlying sediment was old, non-accumulating clay. The highest carbon accumulation rates were calculated for the middle shelf at 12◦ S (<measure type="list"><num>60</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>; Table 2). POC accumulation generally decreased with increasing water depth at 12◦ S with relatively low values at St. 4 (<measure type="value"><num>11</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>) and St. 8 (<measure type="value"><num>2</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>). Accumulation rates were more variable for the 11◦ S transect.

Burial at 11◦ S amounted to 254 kmol C m-1 yr-1 (per metre of coastline). A lower value of 181 kmol C m-1 yr-1 was calculated for 12◦ S, possibly due to the steeper slope down to ca. 1000 m. Mean POC burial on the margin, calculated by dividing the total cumulative burial by the transect length, was 6.8 (11◦ S) and 6.1 mmol C m-2 d-1 (12◦ S). This compares to a range of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol C m-2 d-1 for the average continental margin (Table 3).  4.5 DIC ﬂuxes  Measured DIC ﬂuxes were high on the middle shelf (65.9 mmol m-2 d-1) and decreased quasi-exponentially with depth (Table 2).

The mean global POC burial ﬂux on the margin (1.2 to 2.9 mmol C m-2 d-1) is equivalent to around 3 % of primary production (Table 3).

However, sedimentation and bioturbation rates inferred from radioisotopes with vastly different half-lives often differ by an order-of-magnitude or more (e.g. Smith et al., 1993). Bioturbation coefﬁcients of ca. 100 cm2 yr-1 were derived from 234Th (half-life 24 d) distributions below the OMZ on the Peru margin (Levin et al., 2002), which is four orders-of-magnitude higher than we determined using 210Pbxs. Given the low sedimentation and bioturbation rates at the deeper stations, the 210Pbxs distributions may thus indicate higher rates of sediment mixing and lower sedimentation rates than derived with the model.
