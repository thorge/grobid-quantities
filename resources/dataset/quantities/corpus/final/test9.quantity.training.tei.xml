        <p>The absolute values presented here are also of similar order to the S1 last interglacial soil MAR reconstructed from OSL dates on the desert-marginal, north-eastern Chinese Loess Plateau site, Jingbian (<measure type="value"><num>150</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 a^-1">g m^-2 a^-1</measure></measure> ; Buylaert et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>The 100 year rates remain largely the same, with accretion decreasing by <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure> and OC burial decreasing by <measure type="value"><num>7</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg/m2/yr">kg/m^2/yr</measure></measure> at Station 1 and <measure type="value"><num>8</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg/m2/yr">g/m^2/yr</measure></measure> .</p>
        <p>Although taken in close proximity, the two coreshave different mean Holocene sedimentation rates (GPC 5:<measure type="value"><num>19</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm kyr^-1">cm kyr^-1</measure></measure>; GGC 5: <measure type="value"><num>9</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm kyr^-1">cm kyr^-1</measure></measure>), further illustrating the large variations in sediment accumulation rate that can exist within short distances on the seafloor. Not with standing the large difference in sedimentation rate, both cores give the same 230Th normalized fluxes (Figure 10). As predicted for this situation, the 230Th normalized fluxes of lithogenic material obtained on Bermuda Rise (<measure type="value"><num>16</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 year^-1">g m^-2 year^-1</measure></measure>) are much higher than the flux of lithogenic material originating from surface waters. The latter can be estimated from theflux of lithogenic material (<measure type="value"><num>2</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2year-1">g m-2year-1</measure></measure>) measured witha sediment trap deployed at 3200 m (1300 m above theseafloor) at station OFP (32°050N, 64°150W;Conte et al.[2001]), and from the 230Th normalized flux of lithogenic material obtained from the Holocene section of a core fromthe same general area (CHN82 31 11PC; 42°230N,31°480W) but outside the drift deposit (1. <measure type="value"><num>9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m 2 year 1</measure></measure>;Francois and Bacon[1994]).</p>
        <p>Basin cores allowed us to calculate the sedimentation rates, respectively for glacial and interglacial intervals with an average sedimentation rate of <measure type="value"><num>19.8</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/yr">cm/yr</measure></measure>. The mentioned rates are the highest documented for the Tyrrhenian Sea and among the highest registered for the central Mediterranean Sea with <measure type="value"><num>14</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/yr">cm/yr</measure></measure>.</p>
        <p>We have estimated an average sedimentation rate of <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/yr">cm/year</measure></measure> for the Tyrrhenian Sea. The mentioned rates are the highest documented with <measure type="value"><num>0.2</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/yr">cm / yr</measure></measure>.</p>
        <p>At all we have a sedimentation rate of <measure type="value"><num>17.5</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/kyr">cm/kyr</measure></measure>, respectively with an avg sedimentation rate of <measure type="value"><num>19.8</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/kyr">cm/kyr</measure></measure>. Also we measured a sed of <measure type="value"><num>10.7</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="m/kyr">m/kyr</measure></measure>, also with a low barrier of <measure type="value"><num>10.5</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="m/kyr">m/kyr</measure></measure>.</p>
        <p>The mean sedimentation rates for different sediment types were, however, recently reported by Baturin (2007) with <measure type="value"><num>117</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm/kyr">cm/kyr</measure></measure>. Due to pressure conditions required for maintaining hydrate stability, gas hydrate accumulations occur only in margin sediments deposited at more than 300­350 m water depth on the continental slope and rise. The mean Quaternary sedimentation rate in this environment is certainly much higher than the Holocene value with <measure type="value"><num>18</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm kyr^-1">cm/kyr</measure></measure>.</p>
        <p>The best fit to observations was obtained assuming that the 25% of the total POC is labile and using upward fluid flow velocities of <measure type="value"><num>0.23</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr^-1</measure></measure> (passive margin) to <measure type="value"><num>0.4</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure> (active margin).</p>
        <p>The prescribed fluid mass upflow at the sediment-basement boundary (<measure type="value"><num>9 ×10-9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg s-1 m-2">kg s-1 m-2</measure></measure>) corresponds to an upward superficial fluid velocity of <measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm a-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>.</p>
        <p>Neglecting sedimentation and assuming an upward fluid flux (interstitial velocity) of <measure type="value"><num>0.3</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm a-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>, the critical methane flux rate is ~<measure type="value"><num>3 × 10-11</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg s-1 m-2">kg s-1 m-2</measure></measure> [Xu and Ruppel, 1999]. Later on, Nimblett and Ruppel [2003] used a two-phase (gas hydrate and fluid) transient model to show that pore/fracture clogging due to hydrate formation takes place on a timescale ranging from ~0.4 Ma to more than 440 Ma. The methane influx is about <measure type="value"><num>2.05</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg/m2/yr">kg a-1 m-2</measure></measure> (~128 mol a-1 m-2) at a temperature of ~12.3×C.</p>
        <p>This type of local to mesoscale sediment redistribution is likely to be prevalent wherever bottom currents are sufficiently high to redistribute particles that just settled on the seafloor (<measure type="value"><num>10</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm s-1">cm s-1</measure></measure>; Beaulieu [2002]).</p>
