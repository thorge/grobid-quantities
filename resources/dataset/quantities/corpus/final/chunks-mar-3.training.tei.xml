        <p>Mean 1958-2007 Greenland Ice Sheet annual accumulation rate is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">337</num> ± <num type="range">48</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> water equivalent (w.e.) or <measure type="interval"><num type="base">591</num> ± <num type="range">83</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="Gt/yr">Gt/yr</measure></measure>. For example, Humboldt Main, North, and East were drilled <measure type="value"><num>25</num> <measure type="LENGTH" unit="km">km</measure></measure> apart and have nearly the same mean accumulation rate (<measure type="list"><num>148</num>, <num>144</num> and <num>146</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e., respectively) for their period of overlap (1929-1992).</p>
        <p>The 10 year average accumulation rate for IM is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">1028</num> ± <num type="range">568</num></measure>, decreasing to <measure type="interval"><num type="base">301</num> ± <num type="range">104</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> for the 100 year average (Table 3). There is a prominent peak of IM accumulation in the top three intervals of SH3-1 that requires a scale adjustment compared to that used for the other five cores. The 10 year average accumulation rate for OM is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">462</num> ± <num type="range">97</num></measure> decreasing to <measure type="interval"><num type="base">267</num> ± <num type="range">46</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> for the 100 year average (Table 3). The 10 year average OC burial rate is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">225</num> ± <num type="range">61</num></measure>, and decreases to <measure type="interval"><num type="base">123</num> ± <num type="range">19</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> over the 100 year period. Variability for TN and TP accumulation rates shows the same general decline from the 10 year to 100 year averages, but both show extensive spatial variability at the 10 year level.</p>
        <p>The methane fraction (<measure type="value"><num>0.00268</num> <measure type="FRACTION" unit="kg kg-1">kg kg-1</measure></measure>) of the inflowing fluid is near the equilibrium solubility, and yields a methane influx of <measure type="value"><num>2.41 × 10-11</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg s^-1 m^-2">kg s-1 m-2</measure></measure>. The upward fluid velocity (~<measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>) is not too different from that inferred by Davie and Buffett [2003a].</p>
        <p>In this study, the main boundary was placed at the onset of the Bùlling±Allerùd transition, which corresponds to the biozone 6a/5 boundary in the south Tyrrhenian cores (centred at 14.7 kyr bp).</p>
        <p>Central Chile (~35-38 °S), with the presence of an important upwelling center due to the predominance of southwesterly winds (Arcos and Wilson, 1984) and high primary productivity (maximum values of <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="9.9">9.9</num>-<num atMost="19.9">19.9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 d-1">g C m-2 d-1</measure></measure>) during the upwelling-favorable summer period (Bernal et al., 1989; Fossing et al., 1995; Dellarosa, 1998; Daneri et al., 2000).</p>
        <p>Other studies using Uranium series disequilibrium techniques (as in this study), which include mixing effects below the mixing layer, report SR between <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.07">0.07</num> and <num atMost="0.11">0.11</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at shallow water depths (<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="100">100</num>-<num atMost="200">200</num> <measure type="LENGTH" unit="m">m</measure></measure>, ~12 °S) (Kim and Burnett, 1988).</p>
        <p>Two brief cooling events (<measure type="interval"><num type="base">500</num>±<num type="range">800</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="years">years</measure></measure>) have been identified in the Uk37 SST record (C5 and C4, Fig. 3), respectively at 10.3 and 8.2 kyr bp. Similar cooling events have also been recognised in the Gulf of Cadiz Alboran Sea record (Cacho et al. 2000). This time interval is however characterised by strong modifications of the water column, since all the fossil organisms considered show changes in abundance. The pteropod association undergoes a period of crisis, with a dramatic decrease of shell deposition to the sea floor and the almost total disappearance of this group from the fossil record.</p>
        <p>Finally, based on comparisons between generally accepted values (see the foregoing discussion) for hydrate saturation (<measure type="value"><num atLeast="4">4</num> to <num atMost="7">7</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> of pore space) and fluid flux (~<measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>) at the seafloor. The upward fluid velocity (~<measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>) is not too different from that inferred by Davie and Buffett [2003a].</p>
        <p>Abyssal depth rates are functionally <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure> at the time scale examined (~ <measure type="value"><num>10-4</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm year-1</measure></measure>) and increase one order of magnitude near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and at the Galapagos Triple Junction.</p>
        <p>The 10 year accumulation rate for TP is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">0.58</num> ± <num type="range">0.25</num></measure> and <measure type="interval"><num type="base">0.20</num> ± <num type="range">0.08</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>for the 100 year period (Table 3).</p>
        <p>Accumulation rates in southeast Greenland are found to exceed <measure type="value"><num>2000</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e. and to dominate interannual variability in Greenland Ice Sheet total accumulated mass, representing <measure type="value"><num>31</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> of the whole.</p>
        <p>Reactive P mass accumulation rates (MARs) are ~<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="20">20</num>-<num atMost="110">110</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="µmol/cm2/ka">µmol/cm2/ka</measure></measure>, which is comparable to other open ocean locations but orders of magnitude lower than most upwelling settings.</p>
        <p>The temporal averaging required to attain spatially representative values is longer for low‐accumulation regions (i.e., <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="years">years</measure></measure> for Humboldt, ∼<measure type="value"><num>140</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e.) and shorter for higher accumulation regions (i.e., <measure type="value"><num>10</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="years">years</measure></measure> for NASA‐U, ∼<measure type="value"><num>330</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e.)</p>
        <p>The flux of total detrital material calculated here was <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="5">5</num>- to <num atMost="10">10</num></measure>-times larger than the eolian dust fluxes in SW Honshu and the south-central part of the Sea of Japan, which were estimated as less than <measure type="value"><num>2</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mg/cm2/year">mg/cm2/year</measure></measure> by observation [Osada et al. 2014] and analysis of sediment core precipitation summed up at each category (mm/day) observed at the Tsuruga observatory averaged from <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1937">1937</num> to <num atMost="2012">2012</num></measure>.</p>
        <p>The sudden increase in CaCO3 deposition (up to <measure type="interval"><num valueMost="1.0">1.0</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g cm-2 kyr-1">g(cm2kyr)-1</measure></measure>) just above the Eocene/Oligocene boundary indicates a dramatic deepening of the CCD and coincides with a sudden cooling of bottom waters associated with the onset of major Antarctic glaciation. A significant fraction of the total CaCO3 needed to balance the carbon and calcium cycles in the ocean is precipitated in shallow waters.</p>
        <p>Other sites are also omitted at certain time periods because of poor core recovery in those intervals. Early Eocene CaCO3 MARs are similar to modern fluxes of CaCO3 (<measure type="value"><num>0.5</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g cm-2 kyr-1">g(cm2kyr)-1</measure></measure>) recorded in a 110°W transect from ODP Leg 138 [Lyle et al., 1992].</p>
