        <p>Mean 1958-2007 Greenland Ice Sheet annual accumulation rate is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">337</num> ± <num type="range">48</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> water equivalent (w.e.) or 591 ± 83 Gt/yr. For example, Humboldt Main, North, and East were drilled 25 km apart and have nearly the same mean accumulation rate (<measure type="list"><num>148</num>, <num>144</num> and <num>146</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e., respectively) for their period of overlap (1929-1992).</p>
        <p>The 10 year average accumulation rate for IM is 1028 ± 568, decreasing to <measure type="interval"><num type="base">301</num> ± <num type="range">104</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> for the 100 year average (Table 3). There is a prominent peak of IM accumulation in the top three intervals of SH3-1 that requires a scale adjustment compared to that used for the other five cores. The 10 year average accumulation rate for OM is 462 ± 97 decreasing to <measure type="interval"><num type="base">267</num> ± <num type="range">46</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> for the 100 year average (Table 3). The 10 year average OC burial rate is 225 ± 61, and decreases to <measure type="interval"><num type="base">123</num> ± <num type="range">19</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> over the 100 year period. Variability for TN and TP accumulation rates shows the same general decline from the 10 year to 100 year averages, but both show extensive spatial variability at the 10 year level.</p>
        <p>The methane fraction (0.00268 kg kg-1) of the inflowing fluid is near the equilibrium solubility, and yields a methane influx of <measure type="value"><num>2.41 × 10-11</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg s^-1 m^-2">kg s-1 m-2</measure></measure>. The upward fluid velocity (~<measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>) is not too different from that inferred by Davie and Buffett [2003a].</p>
        <p>In this study, the main boundary was placed at the onset of the Bùlling±Allerùd transition, which corresponds to the biozone 6a/5 boundary in the south Tyrrhenian cores (centred at 14.7 kyr bp).</p>
        <p>Central Chile (~35-38 °S), with the presence of an important upwelling center due to the predominance of southwesterly winds (Arcos and Wilson, 1984) and high primary productivity (maximum values of <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="9.9">9.9</num>-<num atMost="19.9">19.9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 d-1">g C m-2 d-1</measure></measure>) during the upwelling-favorable summer period (Bernal et al., 1989; Fossing et al., 1995; Dellarosa, 1998; Daneri et al., 2000).</p>
        <p>Other studies using Uranium series disequilibrium techniques (as in this study), which include mixing effects below the mixing layer, report SR between <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.07">0.07</num> and <num atMost="0.11">0.11</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at shallow water depths (100-200 m, ~12 °S) (Kim and Burnett, 1988).</p>
        <p>Two brief cooling events (500±800 years) have been identified in the Uk37 SST record (C5 and C4, Fig. 3), respectively at 10.3 and 8.2 kyr bp. Similar cooling events have also been recognised in the Gulf of Cadiz Alboran Sea record (Cacho et al. 2000). This time interval is however characterised by strong modifications of the water column, since all the fossil organisms considered show changes in abundance. The pteropod association undergoes a period of crisis, with a dramatic decrease of shell deposition to the sea floor and the almost total disappearance of this group from the fossil record.</p>
        <p>Finally, based on comparisons between generally accepted values (see the foregoing discussion) for hydrate saturation (4 to 7% of pore space) and fluid flux (~<measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>) at the seafloor. The upward fluid velocity (~<measure type="value"><num>0.28</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm a-1</measure></measure>) is not too different from that inferred by Davie and Buffett [2003a].</p>
        <p>Abyssal depth rates are functionally zero at the time scale examined (~ <measure type="value"><num>10-4</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm year-1</measure></measure>) and increase one order of magnitude near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and at the Galapagos Triple Junction.</p>
        <p>The 10 year accumulation rate for TP is 0.58 ± 0.25 and <measure type="interval"><num type="base">0.20</num> ± <num type="range">0.08</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>for the 100 year period (Table 3).</p>
        <p>Accumulation rates in southeast Greenland are found to exceed <measure type="value"><num>2000</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e. and to dominate interannual variability in Greenland Ice Sheet total accumulated mass, representing 31% of the whole.</p>
        <p>Reactive P mass accumulation rates (MARs) are ~<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="20">20</num>-<num atMost="110">110</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="µmol/cm2/ka">µmol/cm2/ka</measure></measure>, which is comparable to other open ocean locations but orders of magnitude lower than most upwelling settings.</p>
        <p>The temporal averaging required to attain spatially representative values is longer for low‐accumulation regions (i.e., 20 years for Humboldt, ∼<measure type="value"><num>140</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e.) and shorter for higher accumulation regions (i.e., 10 years for NASA‐U, ∼<measure type="value"><num>330</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e.)</p>
        <p>The flux of total detrital material calculated here was 5- to 10-times larger than the eolian dust fluxes in SW Honshu and the south-central part of the Sea of Japan, which were estimated as less than <measure type="value"><num>2</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mg/cm2/year">mg/cm2/year</measure></measure> by observation [Osada et al. 2014] and analysis of sediment core precipitation summed up at each category (mm/day) observed at the Tsuruga observatory averaged from 1937 to 2012.</p>
