<text xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cabozantinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at <quantifiedObject id="39474a47-bd68-43c2-a34a-c4dd00bf043e">a dose of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#39474a47-bd68-43c2-a34a-c4dd00bf043e">60 mg/day</measure>. As with other TKIs, cabozantinib is associated with high interpatient variability in drug clearance and exposure that can significantly impact safety and tolerability across a patient population. To optimize cabozantinib exposure (maintaining efficacy and tolerability) for the individual, patients may require treatment interruption with <quantifiedObject id="31c6ea1d-4590-46bf-88b1-13c87b0b5852">dose reduction</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#31c6ea1d-4590-46bf-88b1-13c87b0b5852">40 mg/day</measure> and then <measure type="value">20 mg/day</measure>). In the pivotal Phase 3 METEOR trial, cabozantinib significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival and the objective response rate compared with everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received previous treatment with a VEGFR TKI. Dose reductions were common for <quantifiedObject id="3f40383f-1a13-45f8-bc3a-d1f8a6689ec3">patients receiving</quantifiedObject> cabozantinib (<measure type="value" ptr="#3f40383f-1a13-45f8-bc3a-d1f8a6689ec3">60%</measure>) but effective as only <measure type="value">9%</measure> discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). In this review, we discuss pharmacometric analyses that evaluated the impact of cabozantinib dose on efficacy and safety outcomes during the METEOR study. Exposure-response models demonstrate that the risk of experiencing adverse events and dose reduction is increased in patients with low cabozantinib clearance versus typical clearance and decreased in patients with high clearance. Dose reduction of cabozantinib to manage AEs is predicted to have minimal impact on efficacy as AEs are more likely to occur in patients with low clearance and higher exposure to cabozantinib. These analyses further support a dose modification strategy to optimize cabozantinib exposure for individual patients.</p><p>Cabozantinib is an oral TKI that inhibits VEGFR as well as the novel targets MET and AXL, which are implicated in RCC growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance [1].

In these studies, cabozantinib demonstrated clinical benefit over existing standards of care with a safety and tolerability profile that was manageable with dose modification. Dose modification is a common strategy with TKI therapy to balance efficacy and tolerability. TKIs, including cabozantinib, are associated with high interpatient variability in drug clearance [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Variability in clearance leads to wide ranges in steady-state exposure to the drug. Generally, patients start TKI treatment at the recommended dose, and if needed, the dose is reduced to address overexposure and resolve intolerable adverse events (AEs). However, there is some concern that dose reduction may impact efficacy. It is, therefore, essential to develop informed strategies to optimize the dose for the individual patient.</p><p>For both the METEOR and CABOSUN studies, cabozantinib was administered orally at a dose of <measure type="value">60 mg/day</measure>, with dose interruptions and reductions to <measure type="interval">40</measure> and <measure type="value">20 mg/day</measure> recommended to manage AEs [2,4].

Clinicians should identify any potential drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications prior to treatment initiation [39,41,42]. Cabozantinib does not have a clinically significant effect on QTc interval; and therefore, coadministration with QTc-prolonging agents such as antiemetic therapy with serotonin inhibitors is not contraindicated. Clinicians should consider monitoring patients with a history of QT interval prolongation or at-risk patients (eg, patients with relevant cardiac disease) during cabozantinib treatment [6,7,<measure type="list">29</measure>,41,43].</p><p>Currently, there is no strong evidence to support dose adjustments based on age, sex, or race [18,33].

Cabozantinib is metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway; therefore, patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose lowered by <measure type="value">20 mg/day</measure>, while those receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers should have the dose increased by <measure type="value">20 mg/day</measure>.

Cabozantinib should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).</p><p>Clinical data and ER modeling support cabozantinib at a dose of <measure type="value" ptr="#bfafab14-ef5e-4758-a8f5-6cbe81a7a0cb">60 mg/day</measure> for <quantifiedObject id="bfafab14-ef5e-4758-a8f5-6cbe81a7a0cb">the treatment</quantifiedObject> of patients with advanced RCC, with a dose modification strategy to manage AEs. Because of interpatient variability in cabozantinib clearance, clinicians should anticipate that many patients may experience AEs during the early months of treatment. Grade 1 or 2 AEs can often be managed with supportive care alone, but intolerable grade 2 or grade 3/4 AEs require prompt dose interruption and subsequent reduction. Judicious use of dose modification in patients experiencing adverse events is expected to improve overall tolerability with a minimal impact on efficacy outcomes. The dose should be adjusted as indicated for patients receiving concomitant medication with strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, or for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (per the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information [6]). Clinicians may also consider patient age prior to starting cabozantinib. Adverse events may occur earlier in older patients, and these patients should be monitored closely and dose reductions implemented expeditiously.</p><p>Medical writing and editorial assistance was funded by Exelixis, Inc.
