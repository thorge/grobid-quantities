        <p>Organic carbon production, mineralisation and preservation on the Peruvian margin 3-4 times higher than the global shelf average of <measure type="value"><num>500</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> (Burwicz et al., 2011). They corresponded to sedimentation rates (ωacc) of <measure type="list"><num>0.45</num> and <num>0.3</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> (Table 2). Beyond the middle shelf, MAR decreased sharply to <measure type="list"><num>132</num> and <num>44</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 2 (11◦ S) and St. 8 (12◦ S), respectively. These latter values are associated with measurable 210Pbxs in the upper 3 cm only and thus indicative of sediment winnowing or resuspension, as mentioned above. A relatively low MAR of <measure type="value"><num>128</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> was also determined for St. 4 at 12◦ S compared to the neighbouring stations. MAR and ωacc tended to be higher at the deep oxygenated stations compared to the OMZ stations, withωacc of <measure type="value"><num>0.06</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 10 (12◦ S) and <measure type="value"><num>0.05</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 5 (11◦ S).

POC accumulation rates for the middle shelf and deep stations were calculated from the mass accumulation rates and POC content at 10 cm (Table 2). Due to recent variations in POC content for the OMZ stations, the average POC content in the upper 10 cm was used. For St. 8 at 12◦ S (409 m), POC accumulation was calculated at 3 cm, since the underlying sediment was old, non-accumulating clay. The highest carbon accumulation rates were calculated for the middle shelf at 12◦ S (<measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>; Table 2). POC accumulation generally decreased with increasing water depth at 12◦ S with relatively low values at St. 4 (<measure type="value"><num>11</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m-2 yr-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>) and St. 8 (<measure type="value"><num>2</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>). Accumulation rates were more variable for the 11◦ S transect.

Burial at 11◦ S amounted to 254 kmol C m-1 yr-1 (per metre of coastline). A lower value of 181 kmol C m-1 yr-1 was calculated for 12◦ S, possibly due to the steeper slope down to ca. 1000 m. Mean POC burial on the margin, calculated by dividing the total cumulative burial by the transect length, was <measure type="list"><num>6.8</num> (11◦ S) and <num>6.1</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol C m-2 d-1</measure></measure> (12◦ S). This compares to a range of <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1.2">1.2</num> to <num atMost="2.9">2.9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol C m-2 d-1</measure></measure> for the average continental margin (Table 3).  4.5 DIC ﬂuxes  Measured DIC ﬂuxes were high on the middle shelf (<measure type="value"><num>65.9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol m-2 d-1</measure></measure>) and decreased quasi-exponentially with depth (Table 2).

The mean global POC burial ﬂux on the margin (<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1.2">1.2</num> to <num atMost="2.9">2.9</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol C m-2 d-1</measure></measure>) is equivalent to around 3 % of primary production (Table 3).

However, sedimentation and bioturbation rates inferred from radioisotopes with vastly different half-lives often differ by an order-of-magnitude or more (e.g. Smith et al., 1993). Bioturbation coefﬁcients of ca. 100 cm2 yr-1 were derived from 234Th (half-life 24 d) distributions below the OMZ on the Peru margin (Levin et al., 2002), which is four orders-of-magnitude higher than we determined using 210Pbxs. Given the low sedimentation and bioturbation rates at the deeper stations, the 210Pbxs distributions may thus indicate higher rates of sediment mixing and lower sedimentation rates than derived with the model.

    <p>The density-corrected accretion rate from all six cores is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">4.8</num> ± <num type="range">1.0</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure> at the 10 year period and <measure type="interval"><num type="base">2.7</num> ± <num type="range">0.4</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure> at the 100 year period (Table 3). Cores SH3-1 and SH3-5 show a marked increase in accretion in the near-surface intervals following hurricane Wilma, with rates that exceed <measure type="list"><num>10</num> and <num>8</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure>, respectively (Figure 3).</p>
    <p>Mass accumulation rates (MAR) derived from 210Pbxs modelling (Fig. 3a) were similar to values reported previously (Reimers and Suess, 1983c). Rates were extremely high at the shallowest stations (<measure type="list"><num>1200</num> and <num>1800</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> at 11 and 12◦ S, respectively). These are a factor of 2-3 times higher than measured elsewhere on the transects and 3-4 times higher than the global shelf average of <measure type="value"><num>500</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> (Burwicz et al., 2011).</p>
    <p>This threshold value increases with decreasing sedimentation rate and reaches a value of >1.0 wt.% at low sedimentation rates (~<measure type="value"><num>1</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm kyr^-1">cm kyr-1</measure></measure>) characteristic for large water depths and open ocean settings.</p>
    <p>The shelf area between 6 and 10◦ S is a major area of sediment reworking and winnowing by the poleward-ﬂowing Peru Undercurrent with average near-bottom velocities of <measure type="value"><num atLeast="8">8</num>-<num atMost="9">9</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm s-1">cm s-1</measure></measure> (Suess et al., 1987; Chaigneau et al., 2013).</p>

    <p>The maximum amount of precipitation in Peru is <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure> and in northern Chile, <measure type="value"><num>2</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure>. This is signiﬁcantly lower than in central and southern
Chile (<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="300">300</num> to <num atMost="41000">41000</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm yr-1">mm yr-1</measure></measure>) (www.meteochile.cl), where ﬂuvial drainage basins can be large and river discharges are high (1-5 to ~23-100 km3 yr-1, respectively) (Arcos et al., 1996; Parra and Habit, 1998; DGA-Dirección General de Aguas, Chile, www.dga.cl).</p>
    <p>All stations located at the deepest sites off Concepción (not within canyons) and Chiloé showed comparable CPE (24.5-31.9 mg g-1) and MAR (<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.04">0.04</num>-<num atMost="0.06">0.06</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g cm^-2 yr^-1">g cm-2 yr-1</measure></measure>) values (Figs. 5B and C), suggesting that they are inﬂuenced by similar processes.</p>
    <p>Areas of highest sedimentation, ~ <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="3">3</num>-<num atMost="8">8</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm year-1</measure></measure>, are generally river mouth proximal coastal zones draining relatively large areas with high maximum elevations and with wide, shallow continental shelves (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico and the Amazon Delta), with rates falling exponentially towards the deepest parts of the oceans. Prediction of vertical sedimentation rate across all coasts and oceans. Note high rates near river outlets and shallow coasts values, functionally zero at the yearly time scale (~<measure type="value"><num>10-5</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm year-1</measure></measure>). Rates increase slightly along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and at the conjunction of the Cocos, Nazca, and Pacific tectonic plates, but remain functionally zero (~<measure type="value"><num>10-4</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm year-1</measure></measure>).</p>
    <p>The exception to this pattern is Southeast Asia and nearby islands, collectively referred to herein as Oceania, which displays the highest intensity of sedimentation over the largest area without the large drainage basins mentioned previously. Generally, shelf zones around all continents and islands display vertical sedimentation between approximately <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.1">0.1</num> and <num atMost="1">1</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm year-1</measure></measure> (Fig. 2).</p>
    <p>A linear regression of Polar MM5 ice sheet-wide annual accumulation rate shows a significant, though minor, increase in accumulation of <measure type="value"><num>7</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e. decade-1 (R2 = 0.11, F test: sig. = 0.018). This increase is better described by a step function, increasing approximately <measure type="value"><num>32</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="mm/yr">mm/yr</measure></measure> w.e. or 10% between 1968 and 1972 (Figure 10).</p>
    <p>Diatoms dominated the PP at both latitudes, with rates decreasing offshore from ca. <measure type="interval"><num atMost="110">110</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol m-2 d-1</measure> at the shallowest site to ca. <num atLeast="80">80</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol m-2 d-1</measure></measure> at the deepest site. The model revealed a much larger intra-annual variability ranging from ca. <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="70">70</num> to <num atMost="170">170</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="mmol m^-2 d^-1">mmol m-2 d-1</measure></measure> with highest values in austral summer (see Fig. S4).</p>
    <p>If the contributions from Hurricane Wilma in the period from 2000 to 2010 are excluded, the 100 yr mean accretion rate decreases only slightly to 2.6 ± 0.5. The 100 year mean OC burial rate for this site is <measure type="interval"><num type="base">123</num> ± <num type="range">19</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> (Table 3), which equates to 10.5% of Net Ecosystem Production [Barr et al., 2010]. In Rookery Bay, FL, 96 km northwest of this location, Lynch [1989] used 210 Pb-based geochronologies from four cores to measure a mean centennial OC burial rate of <measure type="interval"><num type="base">86</num> ± <num type="range">13</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure>.</p>
